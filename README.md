The Object Creator can be used to create entirely new objects for use in < flow >.


To get started, the user just needs a technical drawing of the object they’re trying to create.


The object creator walks the user through each important parameter, presents a preview, and allows the user to save the object ready for import into < flow >.


Most parameters have some sort of visual representation; however, additional explanation will be provided.


    - Display Name: The name of the plate displayed in < flow >.
    - Width, Length & Height of plate: As stated - please note i.prep only supports plates that conform to SBS format.
    - Number of Rows/Columns: The rows (typically labelled as letters) and columns (typically labelled as numbers) on the plate.
    - Item Capacity: The nominal capacity of the item in micro-liters.
    - Item Radius: The radius of the opening of the item.
    - Item Depth: The depth of the item from center of the opening to center of the bottom.
    - Item Spacing X/Y: The spacing between each well on the X and Y axes.
    - Item Offset X/Y: The distance between the nearest edge of the plate and the “A1” item on the X and Y axes.
    - Consumable Clearance: The distance between the opening of the item and the top of any tubes inserted (lids, screw caps, etc).
    - Travel Clearance: How far the tip of the pipette moves vertically away from the opening of the item before moving to a different item.
    - Extension (.fco/.json): .fco is the native import format for objects in < flow >. The JSON is also available so that users can make granular edits in a JSON editor of their choice before importing.

To use the Object Creator, simply input each of these values, ensure the preview looks close to what you’re trying to achieve, and import into flow!
